# touch-grass-app
Georgia Tech Full-Stack Developers students were assigned a collaborative project to produce an aplication/website 
that could solve a solve a real-world problem.

This project introduced 4 students to the barriers and challenages that collaborative work brings. Github was main tool 
used to share and push new changes to the website. This was also the first time the student used a minimum of two third party API's
in any assignment. 
     

Group project members were: Paulo Condori Pinedo, Ashley Thompson, Vincent Yang, Jules Franklin

Project time frame: 3 days July 5 9 a.m. - July 8 12 a.m. (Code Freeze)

July 5 -------------

Group members proposed ideas for the project. The intial main ideas for the project were:
    - Providing location and information for people interested in hiking
    - Providng location and information for people interested in going to rivers
    - Providing location and information for people interested in going to parks in Georgia

Final Decision on proposed ideas:

    - The ideas for hiking and rivers were deemed too specific to finish in the limited time frame.
    The reason why it was deemed as such was because team members search through the web to look for 
    free and accessable API to use but unfortunately the API's that were found required extensive work to 
    fetch and pull that specific data.

    - The final(tentative) decision was to pursue the Parks in Georgia idea due to the fact there were a decent amount of 
    API's that we could use to fetch and pull the information we wanted. 

Brief Summary of the Work done after the decision was made:

The group was split into two groups. One focused on the UX/UI design and another on the API fetch code.
